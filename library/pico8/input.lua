--- BTN([B], [PL])
---
---         Get button B state for player PL (default 0)
---
---         B: 0..5: left right up down button_o button_x<br> PL: player index 0..7
---
---         Instead of using a number for B, it is also possible to use a button glyph. (In the coded
---         editor, use Shift-L R U D O X)
---
---         If no parameters supplied, returns a bitfield of all 12 button states for player 0 & 1 //
---         P0: bits 0..5  P1: bits 8..13
---
---         Default keyboard mappings to player buttons:
---
---             player 0: [DPAD]: cursors, [O]: Z C N   [X]: X V M
---             player 1: [DPAD]: SFED,    [O]: LSHIFT  [X]: TAB W  Q A
---
---         Although PICO-8 accepts all button combinations, note that it is generally impossible to
---         press both LEFT and RIGHT at the same time on a physical game controller. On some
---         controllers, UP + LEFT/RIGHT is also awkward if [X] or [O] could be used instead of UP
---         (e.g. to jump / accelerate).

--- BTNP(B, [PL])
---
---         BTNP is short for "Button Pressed"; Instead of being true when a button is held down,  BTNP
---         returns true when a button is down AND it was not down the last frame. It also repeats
---         after 15 frames, returning true every 4 frames after that (at 30fps -- double that at
---         60fps). This can be used for things like menu navigation or grid-wise player  movement.
---
---         The state that BTNP reads is reset at the start of each call to @_UPDATE or @_UPDATE60, so
---         it is preferable to use BTNP from inside one of those functions.
---
---         Custom delays (in frames @ 30fps) can be set by poking the following memory addresses:
---
---         POKE(0X5F5C, DELAY) -- SET THE INITIAL DELAY BEFORE REPEATING. 255 MEANS NEVER REPEAT.
---         POKE(0X5F5D, DELAY) -- SET THE REPEATING DELAY.
---
---         In both cases, 0 can be used for the default behaviour (delays 15 and 4)

--- SFX(N, [CHANNEL], [OFFSET], [LENGTH])
---
---         Play sfx N (0..63) on CHANNEL (0..3) from note OFFSET (0..31 in notes) for LENGTH notes.
---
---         Using negative CHANNEL values have special meanings:
---
---         CHANNEL -1: (default) to automatically choose a channel that is not being used
---         CHANNEL -2: to stop the given sound from playing on any channel
---
---         N can be a command for the given CHANNEL (or all channels when CHANNEL < 0):
---
---         N -1: to stop sound on that channel
---         N -2: to release sound on that channel from looping
---
---         SFX(3)    --  PLAY SFX 3
---         SFX(3,2)  --  PLAY SFX 3 ON CHANNEL 2
---         SFX(3,-2) --  STOP SFX 3 FROM PLAYING ON ANY CHANNEL
---         SFX(-1,2) --  STOP WHATEVER IS PLAYING ON CHANNEL 2
---         SFX(-2,2) --  RELEASE LOOPING ON CHANNEL 2
---         SFX(-1)   --  STOP ALL SOUNDS ON ALL CHANNELS
---         SFX(-2)   --  RELEASE LOOPING ON ALL CHANNELS

--- MUSIC(N, [FADE_LEN], [CHANNEL_MASK])
---
---         Play music starting from pattern N (0..63)
---         N -1 to stop music
---
---         FADE_LEN is in ms (default: 0). So to fade pattern 0 in over 1 second:
---
---         MUSIC(0, 1000)
---
---         CHANNEL_MASK specifies which channels to reserve for music only. For example, to play only
---         on channels 0..2:
---
---         MUSIC(0, NIL, 7) -- 1 | 2 | 4
---
---         Reserved channels can still be used to play sound effects on, but only when that channel
---         index is explicitly requested by @SFX().
